Raspberry Pi 3 b+ Codes

This repo contains the code that operates on the raspberry pi 3 b+.
I have found the bare metal codes on internet. Using those I am 
trying to understand ARM.

#### Folder Details

**sd_card_content :**
This folder contains the file that should be on every FAT-32 formated Sd-card or USB pen drive.
Without these files the sd card would not be recognised in the raspberry pi.

This directory contains different sub-directories which contains codes to operate different peripheral on raspberry pi 3 b+.<br />
Each folder contains a readme file which contains almost all the details regarding it's respective content.
